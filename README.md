# **My-summer-markdown**
## **Introduction**
My name is Elijah, I am in 11th grade and like to cook. The things I like to cook are egg sandwhiches. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends over the weekend.

## **Summer Activities**

I have travelled to New York, Colorado, and San Diego this summer. I have also been wrestling throughout the San Fernando Valley with the Topanga Wrestling club. Wrestling has provided me discipline for the entire summer and it reflects through my work ethic.

## **Personal Achievements**
During the summer I applied to many tournaments but the first one I competed in during this summer was the All Valley Wrestling Championship. Although I didn't expect a first place finish or even to place at all I managed to wrestle for a bronze medal in which I won.

## **Goals for the School Year**

To get A's in every class and sustain it throughout the year. I also wish to do well throughout my wrestling season putting in countless hours to achieve the personal goals I have set for myself.
 
## **Summer Playlist**
Some of my favorite artists include Bad Bunny, Morgan Wallen, Lil Yatchy, Playboi Carti. I enjoyed them because of how they all vastly changed my mood and improved it. I enjoyed some of these songs because it boosted my energy output.
